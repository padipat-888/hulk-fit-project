# Front End Development

The project follows a standard fork-and-pull model for contributions via GitHub. Here's a step-by-step guide:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the main project repository to your GitHub account.
2. **Clone the Repository:** Once forked, clone the repository to your local machine.
3. **Set Up the Project:** Follow the setup instructions to get the project running locally.
4. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for each issue you work on. This keeps your work organized and prevents conflicts.
5. **Make Changes:** Implement your feature or bug fix on the branch you created.
6. **Commit and Push Changes:** Once your changes are ready, commit them with a meaningful commit message, and push the branch to your forked repository.
7. **Submit a Pull Request:** From your repository, submit a pull request to the main repository. In the PR description, include a detailed explanation of your changes and link the PR to the corresponding issue in the main repository.

ü§ù How to Contribute:

Following are the steps to run the project locally:

1.  Go to preferred folder in your computer and paste the following command after forking our repository (Only one of it if you don't have ssh setup then go with HTTP command)

```
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<REPO>.git
```

2.  Navigate to the project folder

```
cd <PROJECT-NAME>
```

3. Add a reference(remote) to the original repository.
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/<PROJECT-NAME>.git
```

4. Check the remotes for this repository.
```
git remote -v
```
5. Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your master branch to keep it at par with the main project:
```
git pull upstream main
```

7.  Install dependencies

```bash
npm i 
```

7.  Now go ahead and create a new branch and move to the branch

```bash
git checkout -b <NAME-YOUR-BRANCH>
```

8.  To run Frontend and Backend concurrently
```
npm run dev
``` 

*More Running Commands:*
- Runs only for Backend with Nodemon
```
npm run server
```
- Runs only for Frontend
```
npm run client
```

9.  After done you can now commit and push this changes to your created branch, for doing that follow the following command chain

- `git status -s` (Shows the changed files)
- `git add --all` (Will add all the files to staging area)
- `git commit -m "<EXPLAIN-YOUR_CHANGES>"`
- `git push -u origin <SAME-BRANCH-AS-ABOVE>`

10.  After this go to your forked GitHub repository and go to `Pull Request` section. Now you might be able to see a pop up saying **Pull Request**. Click on the popup and you will be redirected to pull request page

11.  Now fill in the form template of the pull request and give the necessary description.
